Project Questions and Expected Outputs
1. Yearly Comparison of Breakages and Costs
Question: How do the total breakages and associated costs compare between the years 2023 and 2024 from January to August?
Expected Output:
A comparative summary showing total breakages (in cases) and total costs for 2023 and 2024.
Visualizations such as bar charts or line graphs illustrating the trends in breakages and costs for each year.
2. Product/Description with Highest Breakages
Question: What is the product or description of the material that had the highest breakages in each of the two years (2023 and 2024)?
Expected Output:
A list of the top product descriptions with the highest quantity of breakages for both 2023 and 2024.
Visualizations, such as bar charts, highlighting the top products with the highest breakages.
3. Leading Cause of Breakages
Question: What is the leading cause of breakages for each year (2023 and 2024)?
Expected Output:
A summary of the most common causes of breakages for both years.
Pie charts or bar graphs illustrating the distribution of breakage causes.
4. Comparison of Responsible Categories, Warehouses, Shifts, and Shift Categories
Question: How do the breakages compare across different responsible categories, warehouses, shifts, and shift categories (DAY, NIGHT, OFF) in terms of quantity and cost?
Expected Output:
Comparative analysis of breakages by responsible category, warehouse, shift, and shift category for both 2023 and 2024.
Visualizations such as grouped bar charts or heatmaps showing breakages and costs by each category.
5. Executive Summary for Management
Question: Provide an executive summary to be used by management in decision-making.
Expected Output:
A concise summary of the key findings from the analysis, including major trends, insights, and recommendations for improving supply chain processes and reducing breakage costs.
